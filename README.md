# Soulbinder

Soulbinder is a story driven, highly replayable, tactical roguelite dungeon crawler. It is written in JavaScript and designed to run on web browsers.

It is developed mainly by myself, @Nitroxone, with my best buddy @wensaqt giving out very helpful advice when it comes to game design aspects. He will also help with the code at a later stage when he feels more comfortable with JavaScript.

The entire project is written in vanilla JavaScript and vanilla CSS/HTML. Everything has been hand-coded, designed and crafted with love. I chose not to use any dependency or library as a personal challenge. Yeah, that means not even jQuery or Bootstrap or whatever. Maybe I kinda wanna prove to people that you can still code in vanilla today and make awesome things, so long as you're willing to use your brain a little more.

The game will be entirely free and available for all to play on a website. 

## Features
Soulbinder has a ton of different features that all contribute to the three core aspects of the game : replayability, grinding, and fun.

- **Alchemy**: Gather resources, combine them together and create your own potions ; but beware of their toxicity level, for it could kill your striders. Use potions to enhance your fighting abilities, recover from traumas and cure curses.
- **Soulwriting**: The complex art of Soulwriting allows you to create your own *Sigils*, time-altered stone artifacts that can alter your arsenal. Crush sigils to acquire knowledge ; put that knowledge into new sigils ; bend sigils by maximizing, recasting, overloading their effects - but as always, beware not to corrupt them.
- **Astral Forge**: push theorycrafting to another level through the Astral Forge, a complex way to alter your arsenal and add new capabilities that did not even exist before.
- **Echoes**: each weapon, armor and trinket you acquire has a unique modifier. These can be modified through Soulwriting.

## Current version

The game is still in development. The core of the game and a few features have been implemented, though the most important aspects have yet to come. 

**Current version**: 0.1b

## Release plans

No planned release date. We want to take our time to make things right.

## Compatibility

So far, Soulbinder is designed to be played in Chrome-based browsers (Google Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc), though it should also work fine in Firefox.

Once it is released and stable, we will definitely try to export it to Electron so that you can play it as a desktop app.

Oh and, keep in mind we're lazy when it comes to responsive design. Soulbinder was made for large screens. The minimum required screen dimensions are 1680 * 1050 (16:10). For lower resolutions, either unzoom the game or switch to a bigger screen, lol.

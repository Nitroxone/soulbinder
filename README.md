# Soulbinder

Soulbinder is a story driven, highly replayable, tactical roguelite dungeon crawler. It is written in JavaScript and designed to run on web browsers.

It is developed mainly by myself, @Nitroxone, with my best buddy @wensaqt giving out very helpful advice when it comes to game design aspects. He will also help with the code at a later stage when he feels more comfortable with JavaScript.

The entire project is written in vanilla JavaScript and vanilla CSS/HTML. Everything has been hand-coded, designed and crafted with love. I chose not to use any dependency or library as a personal challenge.

The game will be entirely free and available for all to play on a website. 

## Current version

The game is still in development. The core of the game and a few features have been implemented, though the most important aspects have yet to come. 

**Current version**: 0.1b

## Release plans

No planned release date. We want to take our time to make things right.

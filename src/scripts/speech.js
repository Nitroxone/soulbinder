It would be very unfortunate to have arrived here just to die stupidly. But the eons seem to trust you; you're not an idiot... Are you?",

                    "You enter a vast chamber adorned with limestone stalactites, sharp as fangs and tinged with mold. The walls are embellished with luminescent mushrooms that softly glow as you pass by, providing a helpful source of light to navigate through the room. The eerie combination of stalactites and glowing fungi creates an otherworldly atmosphere, casting mysterious shadows and illuminating hidden details. The chamber feels ancient and untouched, hinting at a forgotten history waiting to be unveiled.",

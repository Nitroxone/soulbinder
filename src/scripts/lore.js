            "I never thought it would come to this. I've been living in this godforsaken cave for what feels like an eternity, always on the run from the law and society. But it's not the law or society that's going to kill me, it's starvation. My stomach is gnawing at my insides, and the hunger is making me delirious. I've resorted to eating moss and bugs just to survive, but it's not enough. I can feel my strength leaving me, my mind slipping away. I never thought I'd be reduced to this, a desperate animal in the dark. I've considered it, I won't lie. Eating my fellow bandits, just to stay alive. But I can't bring myself to do it. Maybe it's the last shred of humanity in me, or maybe it's just the fear of being caught. Either way, I know my time is running out. I'll probably be dead by the time anyone finds this journal. But if you're reading this, know that I went out fighting. I may be a criminal, but I was never a monster.",

            "Today, I committed the ultimate sin. I killed one of my own. I was desperate, I couldn't take the hunger any longer. I was on the brink of starvation and I had no other options. I thought I would never be able to bring myself to it, but my body was weak and my mind was consumed by the need to survive. I convinced myself that it was the only way. I told my comrades that he had died while searching for food in the jungle. But the truth is, I killed him and ate his flesh. It was the best thing I have ever tasted. But now, I am consumed by guilt and shame. I am no better than an animal. I am a monster. I can never go back to who I was before. I am forever changed by this act of desperation.",

            "This will be my last entry. I find myself consumed by a hunger that cannot be quenched. Despite having consumed the flesh of two more of my comrades, I continue to wither away, my body wasting away with each passing day. The taste of anything other than human flesh is like ash on my tongue, causing me to retch and vomit upon consumption. My teeth have grown into razor sharp fangs, my nails hardened like stone. My once human skin now stretches tightly over my bones, covered in putrid lipomas and rotting scabs. I cannot help but feel a growing anger and an urge to kill anyone who crosses my path. I fear I am becoming a monster, a true cannibal. But the hunger, the insatiable hunger, it drives me on."
